# This development of Cisco psirt automation, allows users the ability to pull live vulnerability (cve) data from Cisco's repository.
The (1) creation of an account, (2) registering of an polling source, (3) generation of shared secret/key values is required for this to work properly.
This script automates the bearer token authentication with cisco, for quick and easy use.
In addition, there are optional .py scripts for data serilizing, and sqlite database creation, and appending for those who would like the ability to match cve data with a living inventory.
